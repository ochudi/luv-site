      "Hello and welcome to this episode of true-life stories about how a little girl broke free from near depression.",
      "I wasn’t the typical child who knew exactly what I wanted to be in the future. I loved cooking and baking, but in a Nigerian household, who would settle for being a chef with “all this intelligence” and “good grades”? I never even considered it an option. Instead, I went through the phase of wanting to be like the people around me to feel “normal.” My mom was a teacher, and my dad an accountant, and I was content with settling for either.",
      "In JSS 1, a class where adolescents try to emulate the adults they see on TV shows, especially in an elite secondary school like mine, I was laughed at for not wanting to become a doctor, nurse, or lawyer. I had no desire to be that busy, so I came off as odd among my peers. How could a bright student not have a clear picture of her future? Guidance wasn’t the issue; my parents and teachers were supportive. But I felt like I was being pushed into becoming someone I wasn’t. I wanted to do something I really liked. However, my interests didn’t meet the “standards” elders laid out. I loved photography, drawing, cooking, and reading. I later developed an interest in writing but wasn’t confident enough to share my work. These interests didn’t seem to promise the billions or recognition expected of me, so I started considering architecture.",
      "One fateful day, I developed an excruciating pain in my lower back and was diagnosed with scoliosis, which I call “twisted spine.” This ended my dream of becoming an architect, the one thing I had grown to love. But as they say, “But they plan, and Allah plans, and Allah is the Best of Planners.”",
      "After some much-needed introspection, I considered my remaining options, researched the professions I’d been told would “suit” me, and prayed earnestly for Allah’s guidance. Between reading about my condition and treatments, going for therapy, and observing the white walls of the State House Clinic, I filled in PHARMACY on my JAMB form. After two sittings, I got admission to study pharmacy in my birth town, Sokoto.",
      "Far from home, I began another interesting chapter of my life. By His divine decree, I pulled through. With my reserved nature, I had a hard time settling in and making friends with complete strangers who had different views and habits from what I was used to. This affected my performance. I couldn’t access important resources because I had no one to ask for help and mostly kept to myself. I felt out of place in a state where people held onto familiar faces.",
      "My life in 200 level was one of the most difficult stages of my life. I struggled with feeling left out, the academic workload, and my health. I felt like a walking shell of myself. When I discovered I would have to graduate a year later than my set, it broke the last string holding me together. My course mates would leave me behind, and I’d have to start over with new faces and try harder to survive or risk getting kicked out. I started working on autopilot, became even more reserved, and lost too much weight. This garnered unnecessary attention. My now senior colleagues, some lecturers, and friends tried to help me, but I thought they were overreacting and that I had it under control until my family members did their best to snap me out of it.",
      "Alhamdulillah, I picked myself up, brushed off the invisible dust weighing heavily on my shoulders, and prayed to Allah for His help and mercy. I am forever grateful for going through that phase because it brought amazing people into my life and, most importantly, brought me closer to Allah, providing a permanent fix.",
      "I graduated after seven years of pharmacy school, thanks to strikes and my additional year. I couldn’t be more grateful to my Lord, my family, and my small circle.",
      "The worst thing that can happen to a person is losing faith. Take it from someone who experienced the bitterness of being out of touch and re-experienced the sweetness of rekindling that feeling of connection. “Do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah.” Fully submit to Him, and He will make your life everything and more than you can ever dream of.",

      "Today, I share a heart-wrenching story about Mr. A, a man whose life was tragically halted in its tracks. Imagine this: you’re on your way home from a heartwarming trip visiting family, full of life and stories to tell. That was Mr. A, heading back to Nigeria from Gabon, after seeing his mother. But then, in a blink of an eye, everything changed.",
      "In a catastrophic accident, he emerged as the lone survivor, yet bound by a spinal injury that rendered him immobile from the waist down. The physical trauma was immense, but the emotional toll was even more profound. Transitioning to a life constrained to a wheelchair wasn’t easy. He faced the reality of his new normal, with his own inner strength as his main support.",
      "Mr. A’s mother enveloped him with love and unwavering care during his initial years of rehabilitation. The responsibility, however, became a towering challenge. With a heavy heart, she made the grueling decision to send him to live with his father, drawn by the faint hope of a better life for her son.",
      "In the quiet spaces of his new existence, Mr. A discovered solace in the pages of Islamic books. Through diligence and perseverance, he wasn’t just assimilating knowledge; he was preparing to impart it.",
      "He blossomed into a respected teacher and a pillar of the community, inspiring many with his teachings and unwavering faith.",
      "Entrepreneurship wasn’t off the table either. He proved his mettle by starting a business, right from the confines of his home, a testament to his belief that a physical disability could not dampen mental fortitude. In time, his small enterprise flourished, becoming the breadbasket for his dependents, whom he fed and clothed for years.",
      "His parenting style was nothing short of extraordinary. He raised his youngest son with a firm hand, ensuring the boy grew up with solid moral values. Mr. A’s story isn’t just about overcoming disability; it’s about being an unwavering beacon for his family.",
      "As he aged, even after the loss of both parents, he continued to be the caregiver—this time for his grandmother. Mr. A was living proof that life’s worth isn’t measured by the physical strides we can take, but by the leaps of faith, love, and sheer determination.",
      "While Mr. A’s story is one of personal triumph against bit-part adversities, it doesn’t shy away from looming tragedies yet to unfold. The neglect he faced in his last days is a sharp contrast to the resilience he demonstrated throughout his life. The tale that follows is not just a continuation but a stark exposition of a system that failed a man of such indomitable spirit.",
      "Today, I share with you the final chapter in Mr. A’s extraordinary story, a conclusion that’s as sobering as it is thought-provoking. A week before his untimely passing, Mr. A faced a new, grim adversary: a relentless medical condition that seemed to mock his well-known resilience. Despite the urgency, his cries for help went unheeded for three long days in a hospital where timely care was sadly not on the docket.",
      "The pained question that haunts us is what truly led to Mr. A’s death. Was it the delay in medical attention, the doctor’s oversight, or the broader issues plaguing Nigeria’s healthcare system? While we may never hold a definitive answer, one thing is crystal clear: it was a cascade of failures that ultimately failed a man of such fortified spirit.",
      "In the wake of Mr. A’s passing, we’re left to reflect on the indelible mark he imprinted on the world around him. His unwavering determination and his relentless passion for life became a beacon of hope for many. Through his teachings, his kindness, and his entrepreneurial spirit, he educated and inspired a community that revered him.",
      "His story, as devastating as it is, sheds light on a stark reality – the necessity for substantial improvements in medical care and support systems for people with disabilities. Mr. A’s life serves as both a powerful testament to human resilience and a glaring illustration of the perilous consequences when care and compassion are in short supply.",
      "We owe it to Mr. A and to the countless individuals like him to take up the banner of advocacy for better healthcare. It’s not just about honoring his legacy, but it’s also about acknowledging the intrinsic value of every person and ensuring they receive the care they deserve.",
      "So as we bid farewell to Mr. A, let’s not allow his story to be a mere whisper into the void. Let it be the clarion call that spurs us to action, honoring a man whose courage and influence refuse to be extinguished. Rest in peace, Mr. A – your strength, defiance, and impact will echo through time.",

      "For the sake of this story, I’ll call my late cousin “A.” She was more than a cousin to me—she was my sister, my confidant, and my dearest friend. A grew up in Maiduguri with her parents, siblings, and step-siblings, all living together in a large family house.",
      "Despite coming from a big family, A possessed a quiet strength and serenity that left an indelible impression on everyone she met. Life for her was never easy; she was born with sickle cell disease, and the cruel cycle of crises became her constant companion. Barely a month would pass without her enduring another painful episode.",
      "Yet in the midst of her suffering, A remained incredibly strong. She was a kind, caring, and deeply loving person who never let her illness darken her spirit. She never quarreled or fought with anyone; instead, she always extended kindness and patience, even during the most challenging times.",
      "A found joy in life’s simple pleasures—losing herself in the words of the Quran, reading books, and relaxing with movies that allowed her to escape, if only for a little while. She had dreams, too. She yearned to attend university, but despite finishing secondary school long before I even began mine, she faced years of frustration trying to gain admission.",
      "Together with her mother, A tried every treatment available—both medicinal and Islamic remedies—but nothing seemed to ease her suffering. For a long time, she harbored one particular wish: to visit her aunt in Abuja. She would often plead with her mom to let her go for just a few weeks, but her mom, out of concern, would hesitate—fearing that A would become a burden if she had a crisis while staying there. Eventually, after years of gentle pleading, her mother agreed. A was ecstatic; for her, this trip symbolized a freedom she rarely experienced.",
      "The day before her journey, A was struck with an intense crisis. She called me, asking me to come over. When I arrived, she whispered that she was in terrible pain and asked if I had any painkillers, wanting to hide her condition from her mom so she wouldn’t be stopped from going. I could see the determination in her eyes as she tried to push through the agony for a chance at this trip.",
      "A traveled to Kaduna the next day, but her condition worsened after standing in the rain. Once she stabilized, her aunt insisted she continue to Abuja, where she would be more comfortable and better looked after. Soon after arriving, another crisis struck, and she was hospitalized. Tests were run, some results came back, while others were pending. She was discharged and stayed at her brother’s house to recover. Her mother kept urging her to return home to Maiduguri, but A wasn’t stable enough to travel.",
      "The crises returned with unrelenting force. She was readmitted to the hospital, and the remaining test results revealed devastating news: her platelet levels were dangerously high, putting her at extreme risk of stroke. The doctors warned her brother that she could suffer a stroke at any moment. But A, ever the warrior, fought her way back to health once more and was discharged on a Friday. Her flight back to Maiduguri was booked for the following Tuesday, and she eagerly looked forward to going home, filled with a new lightness and joy.",
      "On Monday, A spent most of the day resting. She slept deeply, as if gathering strength, and kept to her room. Later that evening, her sister-in-law went to check on her, only to find A unresponsive. She called her husband, and together they rushed A to the hospital. Her aunt was notified, and so were we. We all anxiously waited for news, hoping against hope. But despite every attempt to resuscitate her, A’s battle was finally over. We lost her that day. She slipped away, leaving us with a silence we could not fathom.",
      "When I arrived at the hospital, there lay my sister—my beloved cousin, A—her body cold, lifeless. Touching her hand, I could feel the chill of death slowly spreading, and a numb disbelief gripped me. How could this beautiful soul, so vibrant with life and resilience, now be reduced to what they called “the body”? My world shattered at that moment. It didn’t feel real until they carried her to her final resting place and returned without her.",
      "We lost A in 2017, yet it feels like only yesterday. Her memory lingers, forever fresh, like an ache that never quite heals. I often find myself mourning her, crying for the pain she endured and the battles she faced. Yet through my grief, I find comfort in knowing she is now free from pain, in a better place where suffering cannot touch her.",
      "The upside, if one can be found in such profound loss, lies in the lasting impact she made on all who knew her. A’s legacy lives on in the quiet strength she showed us, in the kindness she extended even in her darkest moments, and in the way she taught us to face life’s challenges with grace and resilience.",
      "Her story reminds us that true strength often comes wrapped in gentleness, and that even in the midst of great suffering, one can still touch others’ lives with love and light. While A may be gone, her spirit continues to inspire and guide those who knew her, showing us that even the briefest of lives can leave an eternal impact on the hearts they’ve touched.",

      "Have you ever wondered if the collapse of one dream could unintentionally pave the way for something even more fulfilling? It’s a tough pill to swallow, I know, but sometimes our biggest setbacks are disguised as the greatest setup for personal growth and self-discovery. And trust me I’m speaking from experience.",
      "Let me paint a picture for you: You’ve spent the better part of your youth working towards a dream, one that sparkles with prestige and promise. For me, it was medicine. The roadmap seemed straightforward – six, maybe seven years of tough grueling study, and then, the reward of a lifetime. Sounds like a plan, right?",
      "Well, that’s until life decides to throw a curveball. My university, touted for its excellence, became the battleground for unending institutional disputes. And just like that, my six-year plan stretched into an excruciatingly indefinite timeline. The goalpost didn’t just move; it vanished.",
      "This isn’t just about a delayed graduation; it’s also about the emotional toll such delays can wield. Picture the passion that once fueled late-night study sessions slowly turning into frustration so tangible it could choke you, you feeling it at the back of your throat, I felt it. I was that student in the 400 level after six years, the one whose spark had been snuffed out, leaving an emptiness nothing academic could fill.",
      "I’m here to tell you that when your inner world starts mirroring the chaos of your outer circumstances, it’s a signal, albeit a harsh one, to reassess the path you’re on. Depression is a beast that knocks on everyone’s door at least once, and when it knocked on mine, I almost let it in for tea, and it wanted to stay a little longer. A messed-up mind doesn’t just happen; it’s the culmination of tolerated despair and frustration. Remember, though, that turning points are often built on the rubble of our broken plans.",
      "That’s going to include a transformative shift in perspective. The silent battles that had become my daily companions started to whisper of a different way, hinting at lessons clothed within the repeated disappointments. The realization dawned on me – perhaps the universe was nudging me towards a previously obscured path; maybe it all had a purpose.",
      "But how does one move from that point of realization to genuine self-discovery and emotional reawakening? That’s what I’ll walk you through in the part 2 of this humble story of mine. I’ll share the turning points and insights that not only reignited my lost passion but also led me to discover a world of opportunities I’d never considered before. It’s about understanding that real champions aren’t those who never fail but are those who use failure as fodder for their future successes.",

      "For as long as I can remember, I’ve been on a quest to uncover my true passions. Amidst the chaos of medical school, I found myself perpetually drawn to one thing – acting. There’s something about bringing characters to life, losing myself in a script, and captivating an audience that truly sets my soul ablaze. Despite the demands of med school, I’ve always found solace in the world of acting, and I’m eager to explore it further once I’ve completed my studies.",
      "If life had unfolded as planned, I would have graduated in six years, and my focus would have shifted to securing a residency spot, followed by the familiar cycle of internship and National Youth Service Corps. But fate had other plans. The twists and turns I’ve encountered have forced me to re-evaluate my priorities and consider alternative paths. I’m grateful for this unexpected journey, as it’s allowed me to discover new aspects of myself and explore uncharted territories.",
      "Med school has been a transformative experience, but it’s also taken a toll on my life. I’ve had to sacrifice precious time with loved ones, put my hobbies on hold, and bid farewell to spontaneity. The rigors of med school have tamed my existence, leaving me with little room for exploration, travel, or even dancing – activities that once brought me so much joy. It’s a sacrifice many of us make in our 20s, but I’m determined to make up for it in my 30s. I’m ready to embrace a new chapter, one filled with adventure, creativity, and the freedom to pursue my passions without apology.",
      "That’s why I’ve begun to explore alternative career paths, ones that will allow me to combine my love of acting with my medical expertise. Who would have thought that an aspiring doctor could also be an aspiring actor? But I’m excited to see where this journey takes me and how I can use my skills to make a meaningful impact in the world.",
      "I’ve hinted at how my passion for acting has been a consistent presence, like an old friend waiting patiently in the wings. Despite the demands of medical school, I’ve held onto the dream of starting my own YouTube channel. Picture this: a space where I can merge the analytical mind of a medical student with the creative spirit of an actor, a place for storytelling and sharing experiences that connect us all.",
      "Imagine the thrill of breaking free from the constraints of a busy schedule and carving out time to do what you love. That’s what I’m doing now. The channel isn’t just a dream anymore; it’s a work in progress. It’s proving that no matter how much your career demands of you, there’s always room for your real passions—at least if you’re willing to fight for them.",
      "You can probably relate to putting your hobbies on hold or saying goodbye to spontaneity at some point in your life. It’s all too common in our 20s, but I’m living proof that our 30s or any stage in life can be a rebirth. It’s a second act where we get to embrace all those things that bring us joy, adventure, and a sense of discovery.",
      "If there’s one thing my detour through med school has taught me, it’s that your first attempt doesn’t need to be your last. I’ve uncovered a path that shows promise—a convergence of healthcare and the arts. And while this might be a road less traveled, it’s no less rewarding.",
      "I really hope that as I journey through this hybrid career of medicine and acting, and share my experiences on YouTube, that it serves as a beacon for anyone else feeling trapped between their obligations and their dreams. Let it be a reminder that it’s never too late to chase what sets your soul on fire.",
      "So, my question to you today is: What passion are you holding onto that you can explore further? Remember, you don’t have to wait for the ‘right moment.’ Start small if you need to, and let your passion guide you. It’s a journey, and I’m right here with you, walking a path where broken dreams can pave the way to brighter, uncharted territories.",

      "Hello, good day. I am here to take you through some challenges I have faced in recent years. My journey right from scratch hasn’t been an easy one; it’s fraught with obstacles that could easily make one surrender. Yet here I am, standing strong.",
      "It all began in childhood, with a burning desire to become a lawyer. Imagine as a child, when asked about my ambitions, I’d boldly declare my dream to enter the legal profession. Despite the odd warnings meant to deter me – like the strange tale that lawyers are buried facing downwards – I stood my ground. This tenacity rooted in those early years set the tone for the rest of my journey.",
      "As I climbed the educational ladder, the hurdles rose in stature. I weathered the storm of skepticism when voices around me suggested shifting gears to mass communication. Instead, I clung to my aspiration and carved my path into law. This resolve saw me through the highs and lows of university life.",
      "The rollercoaster of emotions during my university years was steepened by health challenges, casting long shadows I had to step through. Yet, I emerged within the stipulated time, degree in hand, ready for the next phase. The journey thus far underscored the immense value of confronting and overcoming adversity from the earliest stages of life.",
      "I’m going to take you back to a chapter in my life that felt like a relentless barrage of hurdles. After finally settling into my law studies, and getting accustomed to the university’s rollercoaster lifestyle, a daunting diagnosis came knocking – I had anemic heart failure.",
      "Now, anemic heart failure isn’t just a disease; it’s a personal rebellion by your body in the midst of your biggest dreams. For me, it meant my heart was enlarging, struggling to pump, and every heartbeat was a pronounced struggle, a reminder of the fragility of life.",
      "You’d think law school was challenging enough with the depth of material and the expectations resting on your shoulders. I had to multiply that by a factor of ten. Week after week, I journeyed from home to school and back, making sure to visit the hospital for blood work. I managed the impossible – balancing academia with a medical routine designed for survival, not convenience.",
      "This isn’t the end of the gauntlet, though. Just when I thought I’d calibrated life’s demands with my heart’s rhythm, fate played its cruel hand. With six months of law school behind me and the final stretch three months ahead, a Saturday crash shattered my reality. Accident scenes are chaotic, filled with fragments of what was and what’s to come. I left with broken bones and a piece of my femur as a horrifying souvenir.",
      "The doctors didn’t mince words; they had little hope for my survival. But here’s where my stubborn streak played in my favour. I clung to life with the tenacity of a storm-battered ship refusing to sink.",
      "The repercussions of the accident didn’t just halt my academic progress; they annihilated it. Left behind while my peers advanced, the remaining three months of law school slipped away as I faced this new, darker adversary. I heard whispers of doubt wherever I turned, each one questioning my ability to catch up, to conquer not just law school, but life itself.",
      "After every night comes a dawn, brimming with new possibilities. For me, the journey toward that new dawn was filled with anticipation and the echoes of a previous stumble. I’m not going to sugarcoat it; battling with the weight of failing the bar exam was soul-crushing. The day the results were out, I felt like the ground should swallow me up. Those emotions scorched through me, potent and fierce. But what I did next set the tone for the rest of my life.",
      "In my opinion, true strength isn’t just about getting back up; it’s about pushing forward with more gusto than you had before you fell. Despite a third surgery that left me reeling, I had to gird myself for a re-sit. Less than two months was all I had before law school resumed, but I didn’t flinch. I decided to stay in the hostel, cut off from my comfort zone and the routine physiotherapy that eased my physical agony.",
      "Picture this: every motion is a reminder of your fragility, but you’re burning inside with a resolve that’s forged in the hottest of fires. You can always adjust your approach down the road, but for me, giving up was never an option. The second time I faced the bar exam, I was a maelstrom of pain and determination. Yet, when the results cascaded in, they bore the fruit of victory – I had passed.",
      "As I reflect on the dim corridors of doubt and the bright halls of triumph, I know that acknowledging my pain was essential. Processing the emotions – not as signs of weakness but as milestones of an extraordinary journey – was what sculpted me into the person I am today.",
      "So my question to you today is, ‘What adversities are you facing that seem insurmountable?’ It’s not just about overcoming; it’s about emerging stronger. Let your broken pieces become the foundation for unbreakable dreams.",

      "To understand their daughter’s problem, my parents, ALHAMDULILAH, were determined to find the issue. They learned that I, Mujahidah¹, had the SS gene, meaning I was a sickle cell warrior. To protect my health, they had to prevent mosquito bites and exposure to harsh weather, whether cold, hot, or harmattan. The doctors also advised regular hospital routines and check-ups to ensure a long and healthy life. The hospital then became a second home for me and my family.",
      "My name is Ruqaiyyah Aliyu². I was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia at eight months old, and my first crisis began at one year and three months. This marked the beginning of my anemic episodes. As a baby, I received about six units of blood in addition to the two pints I had. This has been my life ever since, and now, at 32, I still live with sickle cell anemia.",
      "There were many childhood moments when I couldn’t play like other children. I stayed indoors, tucked under blankets, struggling with joint pain or a swollen spleen. The weather would change, and so would my body. I was often rushed to the hospital, and these experiences became as normal as birthdays and holidays.",
      "At 15, I collapsed from severe anemia. I was rushed to the emergency unit, and again, blood was transfused. Another episode occurred when I was dehydrated and stressed out. Mama came home to find me restless; I was suffering from cholera. I was rushed to the hospital and stayed there for two days.",
      "The hospital became a safe haven, a familiar place filled with the scent of disinfectant and the sound of beeping monitors. Despite the constant struggle, I went to school, sat for my Junior Secondary School Certificate Examination, and excelled. Later, I was offered a place in mass communication under the College of Arts and Humanities after I returned to school to re-sit the West African Examination Council examination.",
      "I wrote the exam and passed, despite being sick during the examination period. I was admitted into the National Diploma programme in Mass Communication and managed to complete my education. Afterward, I applied for the Higher National Diploma (HND), and I was accepted. I completed my HND in 2019.",

      "Safiyya’s story is a heart-wrenching example of resilience in the face of relentless challenges. Picture this: a single mother working her fingers to the bone, juggling two jobs just to keep a roof over her head and food on the table for her two young kids. It’s a daily grind, and the struggle is real.",
      "Every penny she earns is carefully allocated. Rent? Check. Groceries? Check. Bills? Double-check. But there’s barely anything left for emergencies or unexpected expenses. Life doesn’t cut her any slack. She’s constantly on the edge, trying to make ends meet while nurturing her children and ensuring they have a chance at a better future.",
      "Balancing work and home is like walking a tightrope. Imagine the stress of worrying about whether you’ll make enough this month to cover everything. And despite the exhaustion, the late nights, and the early mornings, Safiyya’s primary focus remains her children. They are her joy, her driving force, and her reason to keep pushing forward each day.",
      "Just when Safiyya thought things couldn’t get worse, her car broke down. Without it, getting to her two jobs meant walking miles through the rain, often arriving at work soaked and cold. Then her young son fell ill, and without enough money for a doctor, she faced a special kind of helplessness.",
      "Despite all this, Safiyya kept going—until she lost both jobs. Unable to pay rent, she was evicted and moved into a shelter with her children. The emotional toll was crushing. She felt like she had failed, but the shelter provided a small community and some relief.",
      "She continued searching for work, but the stress mounted. Her daughter was bullied for their living situation, and eventually, they were forced to leave the shelter. Safiyya sent her children to live with her sister, while she wandered the streets—homeless, alone, and broken.",
      "One day, she noticed a flyer for a nonprofit offering job training and housing help. Desperate, she walked into the office and met Kabir, a kind counselor who listened without judgment. He enrolled her in a program to rebuild her life—slowly, step by step.",
      "She found work at a cafe, saved money, began therapy, and started visiting her children on weekends. Eventually, she was able to rent a small apartment and reunite with her kids. Each step forward became a victory, each dollar saved a symbol of resilience.",
      "Inspired by her recovery, Safiyya began volunteering at the nonprofit. She returned to school, earned a degree in social work, and became a counselor. Drawing on her own experiences, she offered not just help but hope—and her children saw their mother as a warrior, not just a survivor.",
      "Safiyya’s passion took her into underserved communities, where she became an advocate and counselor. She believed deeply in helping people access support systems and navigate complex challenges. Her approach was rooted in empathy, listening, and tailored solutions.",
      "In one neighborhood, she met Fauziya, a bright 12-year-old in a shelter. Recognizing her potential, Safiyya helped pair her with a mentor, leading to improvements in school and confidence. This inspired Safiyya to start a mentorship program focused on nurturing at-risk youth.",
      "Seeing the impact on Fauziya, Safiyya founded her own nonprofit organization. It provided education, mentorship, and emotional support to children who needed it most. Though the work was hard, her vision attracted others and began to change lives across the city.",
      "The organization flourished, and stories like Fauziya’s became the norm. Empowered youth began mentoring others. Safiyya’s programs created a ripple effect—one that transformed not just individuals, but entire communities.",
      "As her nonprofit grew, so did her voice. Safiyya wrote a bestselling book, spoke at events, and became a symbol of resilience and change. Her children carried forward her legacy of compassion, and her story touched lives far beyond her neighborhood.",
      "In her later years, Safiyya looked back with gratitude. She had faced homelessness, heartbreak, and hardship—but built something beautiful from the pain. Her story reminds us that through empathy, determination, and support, even the darkest chapters can lead to light.",

      "Hi, I’m going to take you through a personal real-life tale that intertwines the challenge of academic pursuit with the tapestry of personal development in a pharmacy school. It all started when I secured admission into Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto, which many regard as the most prestigious and peaceful university in Nigeria. I remember the joy that swept over me; it was overwhelming because, against all odds, I got into the course I applied for.",
      "You’re going to find out about how my experiences in the first year set the stage for the rest of my school life. Classes commenced swiftly in January 2017, and our first departmental lecture, PCP101 or Introduction to Pharmacy, was on the schedule each Friday. Alongside this were foundational courses like Math and Physics held at the Main Campus. Even a month-long ASUU strike couldn’t dampen the excitement I felt during my first year.",
      "In my opinion, the real taste of what it meant to study pharmacy didn’t hit until the move to the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH) for our sophomore year. That’s when things started to ramp up. The complexity and volume of departmental courses piled on, and we found ourselves juggling these with cognate courses at the College of Health Sciences alongside other paramedical students. I won’t sugarcoat it; it was a struggle.",
      "Choose something that resonates with you. For me, handling the advanced courses struck a chord of anxiety I had not anticipated. The second year, known for its rate-limiting stage reputation, did not disappoint in its rigor. Pharmaceutics, especially PCT201 and PCT205, posed as my Achilles’ heel, shrugging my affinity for the straightforwardness of non-calculus subjects. Despite not being a prodigy nor a slacker, just your average student, the shock of having to resit five courses hit me hard. But you know what? This was only the prelude to the resilience I was yet to muster for the coming years.",
      "In my story, transitioning to the second year at Usmanu Danfodiyo University’s Teaching Hospital marked a pivotal moment where the academic intensity really picked up. I was faced with a mix of departmental and cognate courses alongside other paramedical students, and frankly, this was no picnic. The second year is notorious among pharmacy students – a make-or-break period that can set the tone for the rest of your academic career. And yes, it was as tough as it sounds.",
      "I remember grappling with courses like Pharmaceutics, where calculus reared its head, and frankly, calculus was not my cup of tea. It’s one thing to cope with demanding courses; it’s another to do it amidst recurring ASUU strikes that would disrupt our schedule for months on end. I wasn’t aiming for distinctions – just to pass and move forward. But, life had other plans. I was heartbroken when I found myself having to resit not one, not two, but five courses.",
      "You can think of resilience as a muscle, and that year certainly put mine to the test. By sheer will and a fair share of sleepless nights spent studying, I managed to pass. Still, it became clear to me that this was just the beginning of a series of uphill battles.",
      "With the third year came some reprieve, or at least so I thought. Alas, Dispensing, a Pharmaceutics course, soon became the object of my distress. The simple act of attending practical classes was enough to get my nerves jangling. Things seemed to be on an even keel until results day came. Resits, the bane of my existence, greeted me yet again.",
      "I became all too familiar with the resit process, but failing Dispensing the second time was a particularly stinging blow. It wasn’t just about repeating a course; it was accepting that an entire year would be dedicated to overcoming this one hurdle. That year, 2019, became a test of my faith and tenacity. There were times when I questioned whether I had chosen the right path – the whispers of doubt can be quite persuasive at your lowest.",
      "But then, from the deepest wells of despair, I found solace in an old verse, ‘Be patient over what befalls you.’ That became my mantra, bringing an overwhelming sense of calm and helping me regain my footing. I steeled myself for the task ahead, armed with patience and a newfound resolve.",
      "Still, telling my parents about my situation was daunting. I feared that they would call me unserious, shame me, and perhaps leave me to fend for myself. I knew I could not bear being abandoned by my family, and so, I kept the situation to myself until after a few months, when I broke the news to my mom and dad in a low tone after a family dinner. Surprisingly, their unwavering belief in my destiny and their support were the pillars I leaned on during this turbulent time. With the renewed confidence they instilled in me, I found courage to approach people within my network more freely to ask for help. I found not just comfort, but an outpouring of support from my family, Dr. IN, my mentors, senior colleagues, and friends. Their faith in me was instrumental in propelling me forward through the turmoil.",
      "As I prepared for my comeback, the world went into lockdown. The COVID-19 pandemic meant another unforeseen pause in my academic journey. But rather than brood, I chose to enliven my spirit by diving into computer lessons, cooking up new recipes, attending Islamiyya, and rediscovering my love for drawing. Another twist followed with a nine-month ASUU strike. Endless delays, right? But remember, delay is not always a sign of denial. It’s in the waiting that we find the strength to persevere.",
      "Now, let me take you to the final chapters of my pharmacy school journey. After overcoming hurdle after hurdle, I felt a blend of relief and triumph. My fourth year in pharmacy school was a celebration of resilience – I had no resits. I’d found my stride with a group of friends, the Mavericks, who turned the classroom into a place of joy and support.",
      "As my story unfolded to the crescendo of the fifth and final year, the notion of ‘financial extortion’ became a reality; yet, it wasn’t enough to overshadow the sense of accomplishment that came with each completed course. There was this one last Pharmaceutics course, PCT505 (Industrial Pharmacy), that wanted to take a bow with me, but guess what? I turned the tables and succeeded.",
      "Reflecting back, it’s crystal clear: Pharmaceutics was my Goliath, and the third year was my battlefield. The strikes and delays, which added years to my expected graduation timeline, now seem like footnotes in a saga of personal growth and victory. Everyone has their share of struggles, and when I see the mountains others have climbed, my heart swells with gratitude.",
      "What seemed endless, filled with trials and uncertainty, culminated in an induction ceremony on a beautiful Friday that I’ll remember for the rest of my life. With the poise of a professional who’d weathered the storm, I stood proud among my peers as we were welcomed into the noble pharmacy profession. It was destiny; it was written – Maktub!",
      "Pharmacy school taught me more than just the science of medicines; it taught me the virtues of patience, faith, and relentless determination. To anyone out there questioning their path or facing their own battles, remember that delays are not denials. Life is indeed a test, peppered with trials that shape us into who we’re meant to become.",
      "Now a licensed pharmacist, I share my story, hoping it might light a candle of hope in someone’s journey. And so, I leave you with a thought that became my anchor – ‘Which of the favors of my Lord would I deny?’ To this, my heart responds, ‘None.’",

      "I’m going to share a saga that transcends a mere chronicle of professional qualification—it’s the essence of my grit and grace in the relentless pursuit of my dreams. It’s how I embraced the profound challenge of becoming a chartered accountant in Nigeria, a narrative woven with the threads of ambition, perseverance, and resilience.",
      "You’re going to find out about an unspoken truth that hit me hard after graduating with my BSc in Accounting. I quickly realized that to transcend the rank of an ordinary accountant, I needed to bolster my academic laurels with professional certifications such as those offered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN).",
      "In my opinion, life presented me with a golden opportunity when I finished my mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) service in 2023. I seized this chance with both hands, deciding to pursue my ICAN qualifications alongside my day job. This wasn’t just about adding another qualification; it was about carving a niche for myself in the prestigious echelons of the accounting world.",
      "The journey was anything but easy. It was a daily grind that had me leaving home at the crack of dawn, spending a full day at work only to transition to a rigorous session of two-hour evening classes that ended at about 8:00 PM Nigeria Time, and finally trudging home for an hour and a half, at a time when most would be settling into their evening’s rest. This was the relentless routine I followed, rain or shine, exhaustion or illness, and as a woman navigating the quiet streets at night, the challenge took on yet another dimension of complexity.",
      "Don’t worry too much about the times I faltered; they were but parts of my larger growth story. When the results came in after those four grueling months, they bore the bitter fruit of disappointment – I had flunked all three courses I attempted. It was a blow that threatened to plunge me into despair, a feeling magnified by watching my peers advance while I seemingly treaded water.",
      "Yet, it was my ingrained spirituality as a Muslim that offered solace, helping me understand my struggle through the lens of Qadr—divine will. Accepting my failure as a test of faith, I refused to let it define or deter me. This moment of adversity became a catalyst, infusing me with a renewed determination to keep striving towards my dreams.",
      "After my initial attempts at the ICAN examinations resulted in failure, it would have been easy to call it quits. But I realized something crucial: failure isn’t where my story ends, it’s actually where it truly begins. I decided to double down instead of stepping back. So I registered for five courses, not just the three I failed.",
      "Now, you might think this was a risky move, and it was. But here’s the strategy I like to leverage: with greater risks come greater rewards. I ramped up my study sessions. Every waking moment became an opportunity to learn and improve. The structure of my life became work, study, and more study. Weekends were no longer breaks but intensive preparation periods. I was committed to not just passing but excelling.",
      "The triumph was not just about passing exams. It was a testament to the power of resilience. When the results came in, and I learned that I had passed all five courses, it was like the dawn after a long night. This victory was monumental for me, marking the near-end of a chapter filled with sleepless nights, relentless effort, and an unwavering belief in my own abilities.",
      "With only one course between me and the professional level, I stand on the precipice of achieving what I’ve dedicated years of my life to pursuing. That’s the pinnacle of success within my grasp. And the best part? I’ve grown exponentially, not just as a future chartered accountant but as a person forged by trials and triumphs.",
      "The lessons I’ve learned on this journey are priceless. This isn’t just about accounting; it’s also about life. It’s about not letting your first attempt be your last, especially when pursuing something significant. Don’t worry too much about the stumbling blocks—they’re there to test your resolve. And you can always adjust your approach down the road, as long as you keep your destination in sight.",
      "Now, I stand humbly yet proudly, ready to step into the professional world, armed with knowledge, experience, and the confidence that comes from overcoming such colossal hurdles. Insha’Allah, by the next year, I will be celebrating yet another landmark achievement: the well-earned, prestigious title of a Chartered Accountant.",
      "The echoes of past victories may fade as new challenges emerge, but within me, a flame of resilience burns ever brighter. Each obstacle fuels my determination, each setback strengthens my resolve. I refuse to surrender to despair, choosing instead to invest my energy and resources into the pursuit of my dreams.",
      "With unwavering faith and a heart full of hope, I know I will conquer this next hurdle, emerging stronger and with a smile that radiates the triumph of the human spirit. Resilience isn’t just my strength; it’s the key to unlocking a future filled with limitless possibilities.",
      "And so my question to you today is, what challenges are you willing to overcome for your success? Remember that the destination—the realization of your dreams—is worth every bit of struggle. Keep pushing, and don’t define yourself by the failures but by the strength you gained from them. I hope my story inspires you to persevere, no matter how arduous your path may be.",

      "You’re going to find out about my beginning, in a quiet village where growing up revolved around patience and resilience. Life hasn’t always been easy. My early years were spent in the embrace of a large, polygamous family, complete with stepmothers, siblings, and stepsiblings. In that dynamic, patience wasn’t just a virtue; it was a survival strategy.",
      "I was the one who shouldered a lot of responsibilities early on, especially during my teenage years. That’s when I started my own little business – selling homemade pasta with peppery moi moi (Bean pudding). This wasn’t just about entrepreneurship, it was a means to an end – providing for my siblings and me. Why? Because my parents divorced and my father, with his new family, could no longer support us.",
      "Despite these tumultuous times – when suitors came calling and life looked as though it might take a turn for the better – fate had other plans. The emergence of Boko Haram in Adamawa State threw our lives into chaos. The upheaval scattered my family, and the ensuing violence claimed the life of the person I had hoped to marry. At that instant, every dream I clutched so dearly crumbled to dust.",
      "However, I had to pick up my shattered self and move on. The years that followed were marked by separation from my siblings, as we each ran for safety in different directions. It was only after three years that we dared to return to our devastated village. But the shadow of Boko Haram loomed over us – a constant reminder that life, as we knew it, had irrevocably changed.",
      "You’re going to find out about the staunch resilience it takes to rebuild a life shattered by conflict. After fleeing the horrors of Boko Haram, my return to Adamawa State brought a swath of emotions. The village that once was the cradle of my childhood now seemed to wear scars just like I did. In the aftermath, we learned that adaptation isn’t just about change; it’s about transformation.",
      "Imagine looking at the familiar through the lens of constant fear. That’s what life felt like when we made it back. Every sound and stranger was a potential threat, and the new normal was all about survival. We were on edge, always ready to run. Yet, we had to continue with our lives, integrating the possibility of another attack into our daily routines.",
      "This period was a testament to my conviction to push forward. But it wasn’t just about my own strength, my family—my siblings and I—found unity in our fragmentation. We weren’t in the same state, but our shared experiences held us together even when miles apart. Our bonds were reinforced, not by presence, but by the shared determination to survive and thrive amidst our new reality.",
      "I’m going to share with you a part of my life that wasn’t exactly a choice, but more of a path I was maneuvered onto by circumstances and, unfortunately, by family persuasion. It revolves around my entry into a polygamous marriage, a union that, in hindsight, I realize was a bundle of external pressures rather than an act of true commitment.",
      "The concept of marriage is often romanticized, but for me, it was a matter tangled in societal expectations and the fear of loneliness. As a woman living in Maiduguri after having survived the horrors inflicted by Boko Haram, I felt the weight of labels such as ‘short’ and ‘old’, despite not even being thirty. These labels came not from strangers, but from within the walls that were supposed to protect me: family.",
      "My meeting with my would-be husband wasn’t the result of a long-term relationship; it began with my cousin mentioning a friend’s interest in me. Initially, I stood my ground: I did not wish to be a second wife. But in time, relentless persuasion by my aunt – driven by her belief that I should seize any marriage opportunity – wore me down. Notwithstanding his attentive countenance and romantic gestures, the core of our relationship was shaped by external expectations rather than mutual affection.",
      "You might be wondering how I went from saying ‘no’ to stepping into a situation I was wary of. It wasn’t a sudden change of heart, but rather a gradual succumbing to the narrative that ‘this was my chance’ to evade the stigma of not being married. My aunt’s voice proved to be more influential than my own reservations. With the added pressure from having to convince my reluctant mother, family dynamics played a significant role in steering me toward this marriage.",
      "Walking into my new home was supposed to be the beginning of a joyous chapter. Instead, I faced the harsh reality of a husband’s neglect. Unlike the faintly lit hope I harbored, the house lacked the basic comfort of nets, curtains, or even a proper bathroom. My aunt had a mat for me, a small mercy in a situation where I expected marital bliss.",
      "My struggles weren’t confined to the physical discomforts of my living space. Eating became a sporadic occurrence, with days stretching out before the charcoal was lit to cook a simple meal. My husband’s absence was both physical and financial; excuses about his responsibilities to his other wife did little to abate my hunger or frustration.",
      "If I dared voice my concerns, they were met with admonitions to be patient. Patience, it seemed, was the plaster expected to mend the gaping cracks of our home. But patience cannot feed an empty stomach nor warm a lonely heart. And when I took the initiative to start a business, my earnings were taken by the man who was meant to be my partner and protector.",
      "Months turned to years, and the man I’d wed continued to prioritize his work over our household, sometimes vanishing for months without providing any financial support. My mom had to keep sending me foodstuffs. Clearly, I wasn’t welcome. I was too distracted by misery and negligence from my husband to know that I got pregnant, and sadly I lost the baby in a deadly miscarriage. My sister had to come to help me because I wasn’t strong due to the several complications of the miscarriage.",
      "The aunt who once urged me to marry now turned her back, unwilling to lend an ear to my troubles.",
      "The final crack came sharply – a slap. It was the escalation from emotional to physical abuse, and it served as a wakeup call. Relationships ought to be sanctuaries of safety and mutual respect; mine had become a prison of despair. It was a moment of clarity amidst the chaos: I would no longer accept this as my life.",
      "In my village now, I’m rediscovering what it means to be at the helm of my own life, post-divorce. It’s not been a picnic, with the whispers of the past echoing around and the challenges of a community quick to judge.",
      "I’ve learned that the road to reclaiming autonomy is paved with hard truths and tougher choices. People talk, stepmothers might scoff, and even though my mom’s ‘I told you so’ stings, none of these are my primary concern anymore.",
      "I’ve faced the fact that my plight is not just a tangle of unfortunate events; it’s a stark reminder that my voice and decisions matter. Through this ordeal, I’ve grasped the importance of listening not just to what is expected of me, but to my own convictions.",
      "I’m moved to take charge of my narrative and fight for the life I believe in. That starts by confronting the man who promised to share a life with me but instead shared misery. I’m mindful enough to see the value in seeking legal advice and strong enough to go through with the decision to divorce, despite the prolonged silence and the appeals for patience.",
      "It may have seemed like my fate was decided for me, but my story doesn’t end with what’s been dealt. Moving forward, I am laying down a blueprint to thrive, one that includes being patient, steadfast in the quest for justice and love, and above all, a builder of a life that belongs to me and no one else.",

      "Getting that divorce letter was like a rollercoaster of emotions. I felt a strange mix of happiness and sadness. Happy to finally be free from a toxic marriage, but sad because someone I had once thought cared about me had instead chosen a path of humiliation and abuse. It’s a messy business, dealing with emotions like that. But one thing I’m sure about: my life doesn’t revolve around any man, and that’s a freedom I cherish.",
      "Living with my mom during the iddah – that three-month waiting period post-divorce – became a time for reflection. It was about reconnecting with myself and figuring out what life looked like beyond the shadows of a failed marriage. The end of that period was approaching, and with it came a sense of trying to reclaim control over my life.",
      "Health-wise, things took a bit of a turn. About a month after the divorce came through, I found myself dealing with high blood pressure – a not-so-welcome guest amidst all the chaos. My mom, sweet thing, kept saying to quit worrying, that thinking too much would only make things worse. Easier said than done though, right? Life doesn’t stop just because you want it to. It kept intruding into quiet moments, thoughts racing about the future and how to make life meaningful again.",
      "Starting over was daunting, but I’ve always been a go-getter. I channeled that determination into something tangible. I started a food business, whipping up homemade spaghetti with pepper sauce among other things, to bring in money. It was a way of grounding myself, finding some stability. Everything got simpler, from selling locally-sewn materials to light bags, because the last thing I needed was stress with my health being a concern.",
      "More than that, it taught me that there was strength to be found even when everything seems upside down. I’ve aimed to focus on what I can control – my effort, persistence, and the renewed focus on building a future that reflects me and my aspirations. For anyone in a similar place, embrace the journey to rediscover yourself. It can start with small steps, one day at a time.",
      "The night of the flood is one I won’t ever forget. It was supposed to be just another evening, rain pouring down as usual. But then, my grandma was banging on our door, screaming our names to wake us up. The village was flooding, fast. Imagine waking to that kind of chaos? You can barely think, let alone plan. We scrambled, grabbed our phones, and just ran. Everything else was washed away by the time the water settled.",
      "Standing there in the aftermath, looking at what used to be our home—just mud and broken bits—was gut-wrenching. My mom’s stock of beans, rice, and corn swamped, sprouts already shooting up, a real pitiful sight. There’s something incredibly sobering about losing everything, knowing that all you have left is family and hope.",
      "Displacement is hard. We found refuge wherever we could—in a primary school classroom, sometimes a police station. No mats, no covers, just concrete floors and each other for comfort. Food was no longer a given; we had to stand in line like everyone else, waiting for basic supplies. And suddenly, your whole existence boils down to survival. A tough pill to swallow, seeing my family go through that.",
      "But despite it all, there’s a lesson in perseverance and community. When everything’s stripped away, people stick together. We’re stronger when we hold each other up, sharing not just resources, but stories, laughs, and hope. At moments like these, it’s crucial to remember that things will get better. Eventually.

      "Envy. That sneaky little emotion we all know too well. It creeps in quietly, whispering comparisons and stirring up resentment—even when we think we’ve got it all under control.",
      "Let me tell you a story. It’s funny in hindsight, a little painful in the moment, and packed with a lesson you won’t soon forget.",
      "There was once a personal assistant—loyal, trusted, and ever-present—working for a very powerful politician. This PA had seen it all: the grand gestures, the luxury gifts, and the ever-spinning wheels of influence. Whenever the boss decided to gift someone a car (yes, a car), it was the PA who handled everything—registration, keys, ribbons, the works.",
      "But despite years of faithful service, the PA had never received so much as a set of wheels. Not even a scooter.",
      "And that, dear reader, is when envy started to bubble.",
      "One day, the boss cheerfully called out, “Let’s gift a car to my old friend, Mr. K. Can you take care of it?”",
      "The PA, tight-lipped and stewing in silent bitterness, nodded. But something inside him snapped. “Why always someone else? Why never me?” he thought.",
      "So instead of sourcing a sleek, new car like he usually would, he returned with a dilapidated, white Volkswagen Golf 1. One door. Barely running. Held together by sheer willpower and nostalgia.",
      "He handed over the keys with a forced grin, suppressing a bitter laugh. “Perfect choice,” he said sarcastically.",
      "But the boss didn’t seem upset. Instead, he burst into laughter and said, “I knew you’d do something like this. That car? It was meant for you—a surprise gift for all your hard work.”",
      "Silence.",
      "The PA’s grin evaporated.",
      "His stomach dropped.",
      "Cue the internal spiral: regret, self-loathing, and a fast-approaching existential crisis.",
      "That, my friends, is the moment envy boomeranged right back and hit hard.",
      "What was meant to be a generous, well-deserved surprise turned into a tragic comedy of misplaced resentment. All because envy took the wheel.",
      "Here’s the thing: envy is human. We all feel it from time to time. But if we let it drive our decisions, it can cost us moments of joy, gratitude, and connection.",
      "This story isn’t just a laugh at one man’s blunder (although it is a little funny); it’s a reminder. Check your envy at the door. Appreciate what you have. And trust that sometimes, life is just waiting to surprise you when you least expect it.",
      "Because while envy can cloud your view, gratitude clears the way for something better.",
